L9

(in progress)
L9 is a dynamically typed, Object-oriented, and intrepreted language. 
The compiler written from scratch having performance in mind. 
Maybe in the future, compile down to assembly to get true performance.

Intrepreter is based on register-based bytecode instruction set.

It's good programming exercise to design high performance compiler from scratch.
