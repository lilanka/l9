## Design of L9
some features of L9 language
* Dynamic typing.
* Automatic memory management.

### Data Types
* Booleans: ``true``, ``false``
* Numbers: For now L9 has only double-precesion floating point numbers.
* Strings: Just like other languages. Strings are enclosed in double quotes.
* Null: No-value is encoded as ```none``` as in Python.

### Arithmetic
It has basic arithmetics everyone knows. (add, substraction, multiply, division).

### Comparison and Inequals
Same as other lanuges. (```<,>, <=, >=, ==, !=```)

### Logical 
It has Python like syntax. (```not true```, ```not false```, ```or, and```)

### Variables
It's just like Python. If you want to define variable type, use ```<type> <varname> = <value>```

### Comments
Single line comments ```//```, and multi line comments starts as ```/-``` and end 
as ```-/```

### Control flow
Use if else as 
```c
if (<condition>) {
  // do the thing
} else {
  // do other thing
}
```
While loop
```c
while (<condition>) {
  // do the thing
}
```
for loop
```lua
for (<init>, <min/max valeu>, <increment/decrement>) {
  // do the thing
}
```

### Functions
Here is an example
```rust
fn add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

### Closures
Functions are real values that can get reference to, store, pass around. For
example
```rust
fn add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

fn value(a) {
  return a;
}

print(value(1, 3))
```

### Classes
Just like most programming languages L9 classes have constructors.
```c++
class Book{
  fn Book() {
    this.n_rules = 5
  }

  fn num_rules() { 
    return this.n_rules 
  }
}
```
